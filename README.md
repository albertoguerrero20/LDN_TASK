# LDN_UT2_Task_3

Task 3 involves the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Boostrap.

In this project, I have created HTML and CSS documents based on an image from Dribbble.
A new page with 'bootstrap 5' was added, containing a form and its respective validation.

I was inspired by the [Angular](www.angular.dev) website to create the 'parallax' effect at the beginning of the page. I also took reference from various pages, including [Apple](https://www.apple.com/es/airpods/), for the overall page design.

Other webside [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/).
## Getting Started

Read the following instructions to download and view the documents.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a computer that can download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a web browser to view the document.

### Installing



1.  

    Download Visual Studio Code and install the "Live Preview" extension.

2.  

    Open the files in the folder using Visual Studio Code.
